 Systematic Literature Review of Prompt Engineering and AI on Graphic Designing

## Abstract
Graphic design and filmography are undeniably among the most challenging and demanding sectors
in today's world. Just a few years ago, graphic designers faced the arduous task of manually ediƟng
images, including the painstaking process of removing backgrounds. This involved designers
meƟculously using a mouse cursor to erase the background unƟl it was eliminated. However, the
advent of ArƟficial Intelligence (AI) has revoluƟonized this industry, making tasks like background
removal remarkably efficient and saving designers a significant amount of Ɵme. AI has emerged as a
game-changer for graphic designers, offering a plethora of tools and techniques that simplify and
streamline the creaƟve process. The technology's impact is parƟcularly evident in automaƟng tasks
that were once painstakingly manual, such as background removal. Designers can now rely on AIpowered soŌware to swiŌly and accurately remove backgrounds from images, freeing up their Ɵme
for more creaƟve and complex aspects of their work. The Ɵme-saving benefits of AI in graphic design
cannot be overstated. What previously consumed hours of tedious labour can now be accomplished
within mere minutes, thanks to AI algorithms that can swiŌly and accurately idenƟfy and remove
backgrounds from images. This efficiency has not only boosted producƟvity but has also enhanced
the overall quality of graphic design work. For this systemaƟc literature review paper, a rigorous
methodology was employed to gather relevant informaƟon. The process involved exploring journals
and arƟcles from reputable sources, including the ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore,
and others. The PQ4R theory, which stands for Preview, QuesƟon, Read, Reflect, Recite, and Review,
was uƟlized to ensure a systemaƟc and comprehensive review of the exisƟng literature and by
checking all the papers on how ArƟficial intelligence is like a helpful assistant for designers. It makes
graphic design easier and improves the final look. AI tools assist human designers by simplifying the
process, making it faster and smarter. This technology helps create designs quickly and efficiently,
which is not only valuable for theory but also very pracƟcal in real-world design work.1
