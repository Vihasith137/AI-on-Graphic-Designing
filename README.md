 Systematic Literature Review of Prompt Engineering and AI on Graphic Designing

## Abstract
Graphic design and filmography are undeniably among the most challenging and demanding sectors
in today's world. Just a few years ago, graphic designers faced the arduous task of manually editing
images, including the painstaking process of removing backgrounds. This involved designers
meticulously using a mouse cursor to erase the background until it was eliminated. However, the
advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized this industry, making tasks like background
removal remarkably efficient and saving designers a significant amount of time. AI has emerged as a
game-changer for graphic designers, offering a plethora of tools and techniques that simplify and
streamline the creative process. The technology's impact is particularly evident in automating tasks
that were once painstakingly manual, such as background removal. Designers can now rely on AIpowered software to swiftly and accurately remove backgrounds from images, freeing up their time
for more creative and complex aspects of their work. The time-saving benefits of AI in graphic design
cannot be overstated. What previously consumed hours of tedious labour can now be accomplished
within mere minutes, thanks to AI algorithms that can swiftly and accurately identify and remove
backgrounds from images. This efficiency has not only boosted productivity but has also enhanced
the overall quality of graphic design work. For this systematic literature review paper, a rigorous
methodology was employed to gather relevant information. The process involved exploring journals
and articles from reputable sources, including the ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore,
and others. The PQ4R theory, which stands for Preview, Question, Read, Reflect, Recite, and Review,
was u∆ülized to ensure a systematic and comprehensive review of the existing literature and by
checking all the papers on how Artificial intelligence is like a helpful assistant for designers. It makes
graphic design easier and improves the final look. AI tools assist human designers by simplifying the
process, making it faster and smarter. This technology helps create designs quickly and efficiently,
which is not only valuable for theory but also very practical in real-world design work.
